0:00
and YouTube and welcome to my top 10
0:03
hypertrophy list as you can tell I have
0:07
a pretty decent physique I'm fairly big
0:09
so I think I have some good things to
0:11
share with you guys so I did a mix
0:14
between movements that stood the test of
0:16
time and the ones that I started doing
0:18
recently but that I wish I could go back
0:22
in time and start doing earlier because
0:23
they truly gave me a ton of gains now of
0:27
course this is my own personal list it's
0:30
not going to mean that these lips are
0:31
the best for everyone but I do think
0:34
that for hypertrophy they are top tier
0:36
in a sense it's like my tier list that
0:38
you can find in the description they
0:40
might actually give you a ton of results
0:42
as well
0:43
in terms of the way the list is
0:45
structured it's quite simple there are
0:48
10 lives in there and are ranked in
0:50
order of importance so when I look at my
0:52
physique today I look at my gains I
0:55
think to myself okay which one created
0:57
this which one if I took it away from
1:01
this list would result in me looking
1:03
worse so in a sense as bodomy mindset
1:05
himself if I was stuck on an island with
1:08
a gun to my head and I was told okay you
1:09
can only do 10 movements these are the
1:12
10 movements that I would do at my
1:15
number 10 I have french press what a
1:18
surprise that a French man would have
1:19
the French press in his list I believe
1:21
that it is a great movement for the long
1:23
head of the tricep uh portion of the arm
1:25
that I neglected for years and years and
1:28
it is the inclusion of The French Press
1:29
into my program that made me love
1:32
training this body part to me most of my
1:35
long head gains which is underneath the
1:37
arm came from The French Press and I
1:39
love to do them with a dumb dog now the
1:42
issue with the dumbbell is that you run
1:44
the risk of developing tendonitis which
1:46
I've had and when that happens you're
1:47
stuck you can't progress anymore because
1:49
you cannot spam the movement and the
1:51
movement that is not spammable will not
1:53
get too much gains but I have found ways
1:55
around it so for example if you have a
1:57
cable Stack The French Press with the
1:58
cable stack is s tier it is the best way
2:00
to do French Press you could also if you
2:03
wanted just shift your torso angle so as
2:06
to do the French press behind the head
2:08
like this with the shift I find also
2:11
that it makes it much more comfortable
2:13
it's a very simple barbaric movement but
2:16
if you have never tried it I encourage
2:18
you to do that now for my number nine I
2:20
have remaining deadlift they were never
2:22
a priority and I regret it because I
2:25
think it was a big mistake I think that
2:27
I really short-changed my gains
2:29
especially in the Armstrong Department
2:30
by focusing so much on deadlifts there
2:33
is a reason why many people nowadays say
2:35
that the deadlift is worthless or
2:36
hypertrophy I disagree with them but I
2:39
do include that for bodybuilding if you
2:41
do 80 of your volume with deadlifts and
2:44
20 with the Romanian deadlifts we are
2:46
not doing things properly if your goal
2:48
is hypertrophy but you still want to do
2:50
your deadlifts because the problem that
2:53
you will run into with your RDR is that
2:55
once you store the portion that plateaus
2:57
is the positive because the negative is
2:59
never the limiting factor of the lift so
3:02
the easiest way to make sure that this
3:03
never happens is also to do deadlifts on
3:06
the side at this point I do both and I
3:08
find that this is the best way to
3:10
progress on the pattern number eight
3:13
might be a surprise for some of you guys
3:14
because as you know I was the no
3:17
shoulder guy for a long time but now I
3:18
try to grow my shoulders and the lift
3:20
that I use for that is the overhead
3:22
press that is at number eight I think
3:25
that if you want bigger shoulders and
3:28
you're not doing vertical pressing you
3:30
are short-changing yourself you really
3:32
should be doing it lateral raises are
3:34
good addition but done not enough so to
3:37
me the vitamins is why they made their
3:39
way into that list because any and every
3:42
shoulder gains I've made in the past
3:44
three to four months I've made
3:46
thoroughly by spamming overhead press as
3:48
much as possible so this is my method
3:51
and this is why I think that you should
3:52
do them as well now what I will tell you
3:54
for this is to find the style that you
3:56
like when I do an override press my grip
3:58
is here it's within the shoulders
3:59
because that's what's comfortable same
4:01
for you find the grip that you like the
4:03
most it could be a snap grip it could be
4:05
behind the head it could be with
4:06
dumbbells it could be a neutral grip I
4:08
don't care as long as your arm does this
4:10
you're good then for number seven is a
4:14
movement that is almost the one I've
4:16
been doing the longest not quite and it
4:18
is dumbbell rules I absolutely love
4:20
dumbbell rules so I would just bend over
4:23
on top of two Dundas and roll the two
4:25
dumbbells at once doing something like
4:27
this and it grew my back and not just my
4:30
back it also grew my posterior chain
4:32
because guess what this is the only
4:34
exercise I did for posterior chain the
4:36
only one and when I started deadlifting
4:38
I think it was two years afterwards or
4:40
two years of doing rules like this the
4:42
first time I deadlifted I picked up 275
4:44
for five with good form it wasn't really
4:47
my first time deadlifting all of these
4:49
rules I was doing also grew my
4:51
armstrings my glutes and my lower back
4:53
now that I'm more into bodybuilding and
4:55
I want a more focused approached I do
4:57
them with only one arm by posting myself
4:59
I made a video about that it will be in
5:01
the pin comment if you know how to do
5:03
your dumbbell rules properly it is an
5:06
amazing movement because you can thaw
5:07
every fiber of your upper back
5:09
stretching and this is one of these
5:10
these lifts were when I see people tell
5:13
me that they don't like dumbbell rules
5:14
my answer is you're not doing dumbbell
5:16
rules properly or you haven't found your
5:18
style yet there are so many ways to do
5:20
them that at this point I I think that
5:23
everyone can find out dumbbell row now
5:25
for number six it's a no-brainer there
5:27
had to be included at some point or the
5:29
other if you're not doing squats or at
5:31
least a heavy knee flexion which is at
5:32
the end of the day a squat you're not
5:34
going to get big legs or at least not as
5:36
big as they could be meaning that I
5:38
don't buy into the idea that you could
5:40
get massive legs from lunges and from
5:43
knee extensions I'm not a purist I'm not
5:46
saying do high bar or die you can do low
5:48
bar you can do SSB you can do hack
5:50
squats you can do belt squats I do not
5:52
care but please do your squats for me my
5:54
legs are massive
5:56
admittedly not defined at all not just
5:59
massive hams but all of that mess I got
6:01
I got from squats I never did a leg
6:04
extension I never did all of these crazy
6:06
things until I had already 26 to 27
6:09
inches quads my legs already that big
6:12
when I started implementing other
6:13
methods and I encourage you to also have
6:16
at least one type of squad in your list
6:18
now for number five we start to get into
6:21
my favorite movements of all time that I
6:23
do all the time and I've done for pretty
6:25
much forever because I'm a troll bro it
6:29
should not be a surprise I am absolutely
6:31
obsessed with biceps to this day if you
6:33
look at my physique what stands out the
6:35
most is my biceps and that's for a
6:37
reason if it were to be that more and
6:40
more people started treating curves as
6:43
seriously for example as they treat dark
6:44
compounds you would see more and more
6:46
people with massive arms actually find
6:49
your style of fuel that you like and you
6:51
will find that it will it will give you
6:53
tremendous results as long as you do
6:55
them properly of course now for number
6:56
four is a lift that shouldn't really be
6:59
on the list because I only started doing
7:00
them three years ago but in three years
7:03
it made such a difference in my physique
7:05
and it impressed me so much with the
7:07
gains I got that if I'm not doing polar
7:09
version or doing something wrong and I
7:10
firmly believe that because when done
7:13
properly they will modify the way your
7:15
body looks which is the point of
7:16
bodybuilding of course every lift does
7:19
that but there is something almost
7:21
magical about pullovers
7:23
it's ribcage expansion until you
7:25
experience it you don't understand it so
7:27
I recommend that everyone try them at
7:30
least once program them in your in your
7:32
in your routine do them heavy to them
7:34
with light weight them with nucleus
7:36
overload if I could go back in time and
7:39
force my younger self to do a lift it
7:42
would be pullovers because I firmly
7:43
believe that if I started doing
7:45
pullovers the first day I got dumbbells
7:47
my body would not look the way it looks
7:49
now my physique would be on another
7:50
level but that is not true for number
7:53
three because number three is actually
7:54
the first lift that I ever started doing
7:57
and that is sit-ups I was obsessed with
8:00
sit-ups like many young men I wanted a
8:02
six-pack so every night I remember in my
8:05
bedroom I would put the radio on and I
8:08
would put my feet underneath the the
8:10
thing like this the the the thing that
8:14
helped the radio I can't speak properly
8:16
tonight for some reason and I would just
8:18
Spam them and this is the reason why I
8:20
still have a six-pack to this day I
8:22
again it's an approach that is
8:24
completely idiotic but it worked and to
8:27
me if you are not doing a form or
8:30
another of isolation for your abs you
8:32
are showcasing another type of stupidity
8:34
but one that you will actually regret
8:35
because our isolation is free guys
8:38
please do it right I I've seen many of
8:41
these lists from many people around the
8:43
community and I was sudden to not see
8:45
more app isolation so I would like us to
8:48
go back to a time where bodybuilders
8:49
were actually obsessed with abs the
8:51
shredded browsers don't have the
8:53
Monopoly on app development we can take
8:55
that back as well for number two I have
8:58
Pull-Ups so you'll see that number two
9:00
number three number one are all in the
9:03
same vein these are movements that I've
9:04
done forever and I think the world the
9:07
most instrumental in developing my
9:08
physique pull-ups are still the king of
9:10
upper back builders in my opinion if you
9:12
want bigger lights to your pull-ups if
9:14
you want a better defined upper back
9:16
area to your pull-ups if you cannot
9:18
progress anymore because you cannot get
9:21
more reps start doing them weighted do
9:22
them with with towels do them with a
9:24
different grip there are so many ways to
9:27
do pull-ups that you will always find a
9:29
method or another to squeeze more gains
9:32
out of them my back before I started
9:34
doing pull ups and after I started doing
9:36
pull-ups is night and day I used to have
9:39
a fridge back where my back was like
9:40
this and when I started doing pull-ups
9:43
finally and I was out of my power
9:44
lifting quote-unquote phase suddenly I
9:47
started seeing some some lat development
9:49
on upper back development so this is
9:51
also really that I think everyone should
9:52
be doing and to me if you're a
9:55
bodybuilder and you do a style of pull
9:57
up Rose dumbbell rows and pullovers
10:00
you're good you got to open back games
10:02
covered throw a hip hinge into the mix
10:04
like an RTL and you're going to have a
10:07
massive pit bull back and then we move
10:09
on to the number one on this list
10:12
a lift that is not even really a lift
10:15
but to me when I thought back and I I
10:17
questioned myself and I looked at my
10:18
body and I was like all right look at
10:20
what you look like which lift if you
10:22
took it away would make all of this melt
10:25
and the answer was obvious to me
10:28
push-ups push-ups made the single
10:31
biggest difference in my physique I did
10:34
hundreds of them every single day with
10:35
no rest day and the big mistake and
10:38
regret that I have with push-ups is that
10:40
I turned my back on them because at some
10:42
point I discovered bench press and I was
10:43
like well
10:45
so long push-ups I found a better
10:47
variation you suck now and I was
10:49
absolutely wrong push-ups are not just
10:50
for novices push-ups are for everyone as
10:53
long as you find variations that
10:54
actually put the intensity up recently I
10:57
rediscovered ring push-ups on an
10:59
elevation that are done for shoulder
11:01
development and upper chest development
11:03
and I fell in love again because these
11:06
challenged me like a [ __ ] they
11:07
are really hard and I feel them in my
11:09
chest a ton there is a reason why if you
11:12
follow my novice program I have you do
11:14
push-ups more often than I have YouTube
11:16
bench because to me this is the type of
11:18
movement that is instrumental people
11:20
talk about building a base building a
11:21
base and usually what they mean is get a
11:24
four plate deadlift that's not a base to
11:25
me that's [ __ ] but bass to me is
11:27
getting proficient at push-ups getting
11:30
proficient at pull-ups that's a solid
11:32
base if you get these two in all those
11:34
then you can move on to other movements
11:36
but never ever turn your back on them
11:38
even if you are Advanced so if you look
11:41
at the top three it might be surprising
11:42
again because these are all movements
11:44
you can do
11:45
equipment that in route anyone can do
11:48
and that is the Crux of it regardless of
11:50
your level in bodybuilding the biggest
11:51
mistake you can make is turning your
11:53
back on the basics I see many
11:55
bodybuilders do that and are making a
11:57
mistake if you got most of your gains
11:59
from something never stop doing that
12:01
thing you can refine your approach and
12:03
add other things on top of it but never
12:05
ever shun them because again you will
12:08
regret it
12:09
if you look at the movements I would
12:11
like you to also not focus necessarily
12:12
on the variation I presented but rather
12:15
on the patterns every lift on this list
12:18
is a classic bodybuilding pattern that
12:20
in my opinion should be included in
12:23
every single program because if you look
12:25
at any of them if you take them out
12:27
there's a body part that is being
12:28
neglected take out the French Press no
12:31
longer the tricep development take out
12:32
the overhead press no shoulders the
12:34
squats no legs the curls no biceps all
12:37
of these are necessary none of them are
12:39
negotiable people talk about the big
12:41
three the big five [ __ ] all of that the
12:44
bare minimum for a bodybuilding program
12:46
is a Big Ten it doesn't have to be these
12:49
movements but it has to be movements
12:51
that Target the nozzles that that list
12:52
covers and that is going to conclude
12:55
this video now bodomy Mentor us to
12:59
actually select other people or the
13:01
lifters that we would like to hear from
13:03
I'm going to take things a little bit
13:05
differently today I would like to hear
13:08
from my fellow Frenchmen people that
13:10
have great physiques like Airsoft erzo I
13:13
want to hear from you I want to hear
13:15
from Lucas
13:17
give me your list as well I'm interested
13:20
in the comments so I can make fun of
13:21
some of you that neglect forearms or abs
13:23
for example and that is going to be it I
13:26
have an excellent end of your night and
13:28
I'll see you very soon
