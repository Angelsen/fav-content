what is the least amount of time you can
0:01
spend in the gym and still make gains a
0:04
lot of Fitness content including most of
0:05
my own content doesn't really answer
0:07
this question for the most part Fitness
0:09
creators use what I'd call a maximalist
0:11
approach to training this means you
0:13
train for as long as you need to to
0:14
maximize progress in other words they
0:16
have a one hour workout would get you 98
0:18
of the results and a two hour workout
0:20
would get you a hundred percent of the
0:22
results the Maximus would say you should
0:24
train for two hours but maximalism isn't
0:27
always the best in fact I would say that
0:28
minimalism is probably better suited for
0:30
more people even if it gets less
0:32
attention that's because most people see
0:34
Fitness and bodybuilding as merely part
0:36
of their lives not their whole lives
0:37
there's also a lot of people who just
0:39
straight up don't enjoy training at
0:41
least not yet and for them a minimalist
0:43
approach can provide an easier starting
0:45
point my brother is one of these people
0:47
he loves Golf and outdoor activities but
0:49
he doesn't like lifting weights and he
0:51
doesn't like the gym recently he started
0:52
having hip pain and noticed that his
0:54
strength was lacking at work so I wrote
0:56
him a very minimalistic program that
0:58
only takes him 20 minutes once a this is
1:01
the exact program he does one push
1:03
exercise one Pull exercise and one leg
1:05
exercise once a week and it's working
1:07
great his strength has improved and his
1:09
hip pain is completely gone but even if
1:11
you are more of a maximalist like me and
1:13
you're okay with bodybuilding consuming
1:15
a lot of your lifestyle there are going
1:16
to be times when you're going to want to
1:18
focus on other things work school kids
1:21
travel and so on and knowing how to
1:23
train like a minimalist will be
1:24
important knowledge for you to have so
1:26
let's get started with what the
1:27
scientific literature has to say about
1:29
the minimum training required to make
1:31
progress in strength health and muscle
1:33
mass for strength it's actually pretty
1:35
simple just one heavy set done one to
1:38
three times per week will be enough to
1:39
induce significant strength gains for
1:41
most people to support this the 2017
1:43
meta-analysis analyzed nine studies and
1:46
found that 81 percent of strength gains
1:48
were made from Simply doing one to four
1:50
sets per exercise per week so if you
1:52
wanted to increase your squat Max As
1:54
Time efficiently as possible you could
1:56
do something like this where you squat
1:57
two days per week and on each day you
1:59
just do one heavy working set for one to
2:02
three reps if you have the time you can
2:03
optionally add one to two back offsets
2:05
with lighter weights which research has
2:07
shown can boost strength a little bit
2:08
further it really doesn't take much to
2:10
see measurable strength gains because
2:12
the most important factor for gaining
2:13
strength is exposure to heavy loads so
2:16
for strength you can get away with doing
2:18
very little total lifting as long as
2:20
when you do lift it's reasonably heavy
2:22
ideally coming in the one to five rep
2:24
Zone this is actually what I'm doing
2:25
myself at the moment for the power lifts
2:27
as I'm focusing more on bodybuilding now
2:29
I just Squat and deadlift once per week
2:31
at a high effort and with relatively
2:33
High loads for health even less is
2:35
required this 2022 systematic review
2:37
which pulled data from 16 studies on
2:39
mortality cardiovascular disease cancer
2:42
and diabetes found that just 30 to 60
2:44
Minutes of lifting per week was enough
2:46
for quote maximum risk reduction in
2:48
other words you can see maximum health
2:50
benefits with just a half hour to an
2:52
hour of lifting per week it really
2:54
doesn't take much however for muscle
2:56
gain it is a bit more complicated that's
2:58
because unlike strength and health there
3:00
there's a much clearer positive
3:02
relationship between training volume and
3:04
muscle hypertrophy training volume of
3:06
course is simply the amount of work you
3:08
do and it's typically estimated as the
3:09
number of sets per week so let's say you
3:11
did one set for your quads per week that
3:13
would be considered very low volume and
3:16
wouldn't cost you very much time at all
3:17
on the other hand if you did 30 sets for
3:19
your quads per week that would be very
3:21
high volume and you'd be spending a lot
3:23
of time in the gym now if you've been
3:25
following me or anyone else in the
3:27
science-based fitness Community you've
3:28
probably heard that around 10 sets per
3:30
body part per week is a really good
3:33
Target for most people most coaches will
3:35
recommend splitting those 10 sets up
3:36
across at least two workouts per body
3:38
part so for example you could do five
3:40
sets for your quads on Tuesday and five
3:42
sets for your quads on Friday but
3:44
regardless the blanket recommendation is
3:46
10 sets per muscle per week and more
3:49
advanced trainees may seem marginal
3:50
gains by going up to 20 sets for some
3:52
body parts but does this imply that 10
3:55
sets per muscle per week is the bare
3:57
minimum what if you did 9 sets per week
3:59
instead of 10. or what if you did five
4:01
sets but you get half the gains of 10
4:04
sets but if you only did one set per
4:06
week would you make any gains at all
4:08
well luckily we do have the signs to
4:10
answer these questions and the results
4:12
may surprise you this gray bar
4:14
represents 100 of the gains possible if
4:17
you did 10 plus sets per week this is
4:19
your maximum possible gains doing just
4:21
one to four sets per muscle per week
4:23
just one to four sets will get you not
4:26
ten percent of the gains not twenty
4:28
percent of the gains but 64 percent of
4:31
Maximum gains think about that one set
4:34
per week is nothing you can pause the
4:36
video now go to a set of bicep curls to
4:38
failure and take you about 30 seconds
4:40
and that alone would get you in the
4:41
range of 64 percent of your bicep gains
4:44
for the week if you do decide to do a
4:46
little more let's say five to nine sets
4:48
per week that would bring you up to 84
4:50
of Maximum gains but it's actually even
4:53
better than that for the minimalist
4:54
because there are a number of strategies
4:55
we can use to get even more hypertrophic
4:58
bang for our buck out of the limited set
5:00
we do this can close the gap even
5:02
further and get us ever closer to
5:04
Optimal while doing less but before we
5:06
dig into those I should point out that
5:08
the figures I just discussed do have a
5:09
few limitations first the meta-analysis
5:12
they come from pull the results of 15
5:13
studies but the majority of those
5:15
studies were on untrained or quote
5:17
recreationally trained subjects only two
5:19
of the studies were done on properly
5:21
trained lifters still of those two
5:23
studies the ray of paper found no
5:25
difference between three sets versus one
5:27
set per session taken to failure and
5:29
this alstroski paper found no
5:31
statistically significant difference
5:32
between 3 6 or 12 sets per week again
5:35
all taken to failure although I should
5:37
note that there were non-significant
5:38
Trends in favor of the high volume group
5:40
second these studies are all reporting
5:43
averages on average people will make 64
5:45
percent of Maximum gains by doing one to
5:48
four sets per week but that doesn't mean
5:50
that everyone will make exactly 64 of
5:53
Maximum gains for some people that
5:54
number will be higher for some people
5:56
that number will be lower I should also
5:58
make it clear that as you gain more
5:59
lifting experience you do tend to
6:01
require more volume to keep making
6:03
progress at a similar rate however this
6:05
doesn't mean that you can't still make
6:07
measurable progress by doing
6:08
substantially Less in fact there are
6:10
highly veteraned bodybuilders that not
6:12
only make do but thrive on low volume
6:15
protocols Dorian Yates is considered one
6:17
of the greatest ifbb pro bodybuilders of
6:19
all time and this is what his chest
6:20
training looked like he hit it chest
6:22
once a week with just one set to failure
6:24
per exercise for six to eight reps for
6:26
him that meant a weekly chest volume of
6:28
get this four sets per week and he built
6:31
a chest like that of four sets per week
6:33
now Dorian Yates obviously had some
6:35
pharmaceutical enhancement on his side
6:37
but they're examples of elite natural
6:38
minimalists as well Jeff Alberts is one
6:40
of the most decorated natural
6:41
bodybuilders of all time and this is one
6:43
of his current pull workouts where he
6:45
trains back biceps and hamstrings two
6:47
sets of seated leg curls two sets of
6:49
rdls two sets of lap pull downs and two
6:51
sets of cable bicep curls that's it
6:53
he'll do some version of this workout
6:54
twice per week so for the most part he's
6:57
only doing four to eight sets per muscle
6:59
per week of course they're all very high
7:01
exertion and masterfully executed and
7:03
you can't argue with his results there's
7:04
also people like Martin Birkin who
7:06
inspired a generation of minimalists
7:08
with his famous around itis article
7:10
explaining how so many people waste
7:12
their time in the gym by not tracking
7:14
workouts doing too much junk volume
7:15
including way too much AB training and
7:18
spending more time warming up than he
7:19
does for his whole workout it's also
7:21
worth mentioning that so far I've only
7:23
been talking about making gains but
7:24
sometimes people just want to maintain
7:26
what they've already built there's
7:27
nothing wrong with maintenance phases
7:29
and in this case you can get away with
7:31
even less to study from Bickel and
7:33
colleagues found that subjects were able
7:34
to maintain their muscle mass for eight
7:36
months even when they drop their volume
7:38
all the way down to one-ninth of what
7:40
they were doing at Baseline it's a lot
7:42
easier to maintain your gains than it is
7:44
to build them from scratch now don't get
7:46
me wrong I love maximalist training
7:48
right now I personally don't mind
7:49
spending one to two hours in the gym a
7:50
day but there are times when I need to
7:52
use a low volume minimalist routine and
7:54
my point with the video so far is to
7:56
show that minimalist training is a lot
7:58
more effective than many people realize
7:59
as especially if done correctly okay so
8:02
with all this theory in mind let's dig
8:04
into some of the best minimalist
8:05
training practices the first minimalist
8:07
strategy is to push yourself harder than
8:09
usual you can have it both ways if
8:11
you're gonna do a lower quantity of work
8:13
you need to ensure that that work is
8:15
high quality this means you need to
8:17
execute each and every set as close to
8:19
perfectly as possible the lower your
8:21
volume is the higher your intensity
8:23
should be to compensate and that's my
8:25
most important tip on a minimalist
8:27
routine most sets should be taken all
8:29
the way to failure so an rpe of 10 or at
8:32
least within a rep or so of failure so
8:33
an RP of nine or so the second
8:35
minimalist strategy is to use drop sets
8:37
in his textbook on the science and
8:39
development of muscle hypertrophy Dr
8:40
Brad schoenfeld suggests that drop sets
8:42
can be used to increase training volume
8:44
without substantially increasing session
8:46
duration to make workouts more efficient
8:49
now a drop set is when you extend a set
8:51
Beyond failure by dropping the weight
8:52
back and Performing more reps after your
8:55
usual stopping point this allows you to
8:57
get more high tension reps without
8:58
killing time by resting
9:00
reps are high tension because the
9:02
muscle's already been to failure once
9:04
generally speaking after I hit failure
9:05
once I'll drop the weight back by 25 to
9:08
50 for my drop set and then I'll take
9:10
that weight to failure again without
9:11
resting in between the third minimalist
9:14
strategy is to use so-called sensible
9:15
supersets now a superset is when you do
9:18
two exercises back to back without
9:20
resting in between it's very common for
9:22
people to do supersets for the same body
9:24
part so like supersetting a bench press
9:25
with dumbbell flies but research tells
9:27
us this is a mistake this 2020 study
9:30
found that training performance was
9:31
decreased when supersets were performed
9:33
on exercises that trained the same
9:35
muscles however when supersets are
9:37
performed on exercises that don't train
9:38
the same muscles both exercises can
9:41
still be maximized while saving on time
9:43
so it would be smarter to superset your
9:45
bench press with a dumbbell Row for
9:47
example since your pecs will be resting
9:49
while your back is working and your back
9:51
will be resting while your pecs are
9:52
working it's also fine for sensible
9:54
supersets to be somewhat random for
9:55
example you could superset leg press
9:57
with lateral raises on a full body day
9:59
because the muscles involved on the
10:00
2xers sizes don't overlap now if you
10:03
were to break down how you actually
10:04
spend your time in the gym you'd find
10:06
that most of your time is not actually
10:07
spent training but resting in between
10:10
sets out of curiosity I did this myself
10:12
and tracked a random push day where I
10:14
recorded the exact amount of time I
10:16
spent lifting versus the amount of time
10:17
I spent resting and this is how it broke
10:19
down the entire workout took me one hour
10:21
and 10 minutes so 70 minutes total of
10:24
that 70 minutes I only spent 14 minutes
10:26
actually lifting and I spent 56 minutes
10:29
resting that included water breaks
10:31
socializing with gym noobs and taking
10:33
photos with fans so only about 20
10:35
percent of my work I was lifting and 80
10:37
percent was rested now I may rest a
10:39
little bit longer than some but I can
10:41
guarantee that most people will find
10:43
that at least half their time in the gym
10:45
is spent resting in between sets this
10:47
tells us that if we want to make our
10:48
workouts faster an obvious solution
10:50
would be to use shorter rest periods but
10:52
there's a problem with this research
10:54
shows that shorter rest periods tend to
10:56
be worse for hypertrophy because you
10:57
can't fully recover in between sets so
11:00
resting one to four minutes between sets
11:02
is the typical science-based
11:04
recommendation however there is evidence
11:06
showing that if you gradually reduce
11:07
your rest periods over time you can
11:09
still maximize hypertrophy because your
11:11
cardiovascular endurance will improve
11:13
allowing you to recover faster in
11:15
between sets in other words you can
11:17
start by resting say two minutes between
11:18
sets in week one then rest for 15
11:21
seconds Less in week two 15 seconds less
11:23
again in week three until eventually you
11:25
get down to just one minute rest in
11:27
between sets lastly the minimalist
11:28
should try to cut down on their warm-up
11:30
time whenever I'm in a time crunch I'll
11:32
just do three to five minutes on the
11:33
treadmill a few quick dynamic stretches
11:35
and hop right into it after a quick
11:37
General warm-up the minimalist can
11:38
choose exercises that don't require as
11:40
many warm-up sets for example if I do
11:42
barbell back squats I'll generally need
11:44
four or five warm-up sets to even get to
11:46
my working weight and then I'll usually
11:48
do two to four more working sets from
11:50
there that takes a lot of time but if I
11:52
do a machine hack squat I'll only need
11:54
two warm-up sets before I start the real
11:55
working sets so by prioritizing machine
11:57
exercises that require less warm-up you
12:00
can cut down down on your total training
12:02
time as well now before we wrap it up I
12:03
want to quickly announce that I just
12:05
opened up a new program for pre-sale
12:06
that's designed to get you in and out of
12:08
the gym in under 45 minutes studies show
12:10
that one of the most commonly cited
12:12
barriers to resistance training is lack
12:13
of time so I wanted to create a routine
12:15
that could have people getting effective
12:17
and intense workouts As Time efficiently
12:19
as possible so if this sounds like
12:21
something you might be interested in you
12:22
can visit jeffnipper.com to check it out
12:24
the program comes in a two day per week
12:25
three day per week four day per week and
12:27
five day per week version depending on
12:29
just how busy you are and as a
12:31
minimalist routine it's appropriate for
12:32
all levels of advancement assuming
12:34
you're looking to prioritize time
12:35
efficiency the pre-order will last for
12:37
one week and if you pre-order you'll get
12:38
all four versions of the program and
12:40
you'll also save 30 off the regular
12:42
price so if you pre-order you'll have
12:44
all four versions of the essentials
12:45
program forever if you missed the
12:47
pre-sale you'll just choose which one of
12:49
the programs you want based on your
12:50
schedule pre-order lasts until next
12:52
Sunday October 23rd and if you pre-order
12:54
now all four versions of the program
12:56
will be delivered to your inbox on
12:57
October 23rd if you're watching this
12:59
after the pre-order is over I'll leave a
