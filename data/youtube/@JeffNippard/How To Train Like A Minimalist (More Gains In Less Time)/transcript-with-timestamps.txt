0:00
all right what's going on guys in this
0:01
video I'm gonna be taking you through
0:02
some minimalistic workouts that'll take
0:04
you under 45 minutes per session so this
0:07
is a two day per week routine however if
0:09
you have more training days available
0:10
than that I'll also explain how you can
0:12
modify these two workouts into a three
0:14
day per week four day per week or five
0:16
day per week schedule so everything you
0:18
need to know to set up your own
0:19
minimalistic training split will be laid
0:21
out in this video and throughout these
0:22
workouts we'll be applying many of the
0:24
fundamental minimalist training
0:25
principles that I discussed in my last
0:27
video which I'll link Down Below in case
0:29
you missed it alright let's get started
Full Body Day 1
0:30
with full body day one so after two to
0:33
three minutes of brisk walking on the
0:34
treadmill in a few dynamic stretches
0:35
just a few arm swings and a few leg
0:37
swings is fine we're kicking things off
0:39
with two sets of flat dumbbell press the
0:41
first set will be a heavy set for four
0:43
to six reps and the second set will be a
0:45
lighter back off set for 8 to 10 reps so
0:48
we'll get our strength set in first and
0:49
then do our hippertrophy set now there
0:51
are two reasons why we're doing a
0:53
dumbbell press rather than a barbell
0:54
press on a minimalist routine first
0:56
dumbbells are generally more time
0:58
efficient because you don't need to load
0:59
and unload load any plates which does
1:01
chew up some time and second dumbbells
1:03
allow for a greater range of motion than
1:06
the barbell this normally isn't a big
1:07
deal because we can compensate for the
1:09
barbell's minor limitation by also
1:11
including a stretch focused exercise
1:13
like a cable fly however on a minimalist
1:16
routine we're trying to minimize the
1:18
number of exercises we do so in this
1:20
case it makes more sense to choose a
1:21
pressing exercise that also provides a
1:24
large stretch on the pecs so a dumbbell
1:26
press or a dip would probably be your
1:28
best options now from a technique
1:29
standpoint I recommend lowering the
1:31
dumbbells down with a slight elbow tuck
1:33
at around 30 to 45 degrees when viewed
1:35
from the top and then as I press I'll
1:37
flare my elbows out if you feel any
1:39
shoulder discomfort when you flare it's
1:41
fine to just keep your elbows tucked the
1:42
entire time okay after that we're moving
1:44
on to the dumbbell Romanian deadlift for
1:46
two sets of eight to ten reps again I'm
1:49
going for the dumbbells here mainly
1:50
because they tend to be a bit more time
1:51
efficient but the biomechanics of the
1:53
exercise will be the same whether you
1:55
use dumbbells or a barbell the main
1:57
thing to keep in mind with the RDL is to
1:59
Simply push your butt as you allow the
2:01
weight to drop straight down under
2:02
control don't think about lowering the
2:04
weight to touch the floor simply set
2:06
your hips back and let the dumbbells
2:07
naturally lower in a straight line
2:09
reversing the motion once you feel a big
2:11
stretch in your hamstrings without
2:12
allowing your lower back to round I like
2:14
to maintain a nice smooth Cadence on
2:15
these where I don't fully lock out at
2:17
the top and this helps me keep tension
2:18
on my hamstrings however if you did want
2:20
to activate the glutes a bit more you
2:22
could lock the hips at the top and
2:23
squeeze your glutes together I'd also
2:25
strongly recommend using straps for
2:26
these so that your grip strength doesn't
2:28
limit the amount of tension your
2:29
hamstrings receive next we're doing a
2:31
two grip lat pull down for two sets of
2:33
10 to 12 reps using a different grip for
2:35
each set so for the first set we're
2:37
doing an overhand middle grip to Target
2:39
the mid back and the lats and then on
2:41
the second set we're doing an underhand
2:42
close grip to Target the biceps a bit
2:45
more and to hit the lats from a slightly
2:46
different angle then after the second
2:48
set to get a little more bicep work you
2:50
can strip the weight back and do some
2:51
overhead curls this way we'll make sure
2:53
the high threshold bicep fibers
2:54
experience a high level of muscular
2:56
tension as well okay after that we're
2:58
moving on to a single working set of 8
3:00
to 10 reps per leg on the dumbbell step
3:02
up this will be our main quad and glute
3:04
Focus movement for the day now one thing
3:06
to remember about minimalistic training
3:08
is that because we're often only doing
3:09
one single set for some exercises it's
3:12
very important that we execute that set
3:14
as perfectly as possible in this case we
3:17
want to be forcing our front leg to
3:19
carry all the load so minimize cheating
3:21
with your back leg as much as possible
3:22
and remember that it's just there for
3:24
keeping balance I prefer to work each
3:26
leg one leg at a time because that way
3:28
you're not losing tension in between
3:30
reps which can really drag the set out
3:32
another thing you may notice is that you
3:34
need to go heavier than you think most
3:36
people stop well shy of failure on step
3:38
ups and lunges so to get to failure or
3:40
at least within one rep of failure
3:42
you'll probably need heavier weights
3:43
than you'd normally use and again using
3:45
straps is smart since they'll prevent
3:47
your grip strength from being a limiting
3:49
factor up next we've got one set of 12
3:51
to 15 reps plus a drop set on the
3:53
overhead cable tricep extension the
3:55
reason I'm going with the overhead
3:56
tricep extension rather than a regular
3:58
press down is that the triceps will
4:00
already be hit in a more neutral
4:01
shoulder position with the flat dumbbell
4:03
press so it'd be a bit more redundant to
4:05
also hit them with a press down also a
4:07
new 2022 study from mayo and colleagues
4:09
found that overhead tricep extensions
4:11
resulted in about 40 percent more
4:13
hypertrophy compared to regular press
4:15
Downs even when volume matched which is
4:17
pretty huge now there's been quite a lot
4:19
of noise about this study online some
4:21
people claim that the results are most
4:22
likely a fluke however according to the
4:24
mass research review it was a very well
4:26
designed study and there are at least
4:28
three plausible explanations for why
4:30
overhead extensions led to substantially
4:32
more muscle growth than press Downs so
4:34
while I wouldn't put too much stock in a
4:36
single study like this if you are
4:37
limited on time and can only fit in one
4:39
tricep isolation movement I would favor
4:41
an overhead tricep extension more than
4:43
press Downs okay so for these you want
4:45
to lock your elbow in place with the
4:46
cable just behind your head squeeze your
4:48
triceps to move the weight and then
4:50
lower the weight back down under control
4:51
and try to feel a nice big stretch at
4:54
the bottom after reaching failure once
4:56
I'll drop the weight back by about 30 to
4:57
40 percent and then take the triceps to
4:59
failure once
5:00
okay after that we've got one set of 12
5:02
to 15 reps plus another drop set on the
5:05
machine lateral raise I personally use
5:07
this Atlantis standing lateral raise
5:08
machine at my gym mostly because I find
5:10
I can get a much larger range of motion
5:12
here while maintaining consistent
5:13
tension on my side delts however if you
5:15
don't have this machine you can use a
5:17
seated machine option or a cable machine
5:18
or even dumbbells as long as you're
5:20
taking the muscle to failure with good
5:22
form the fibers will be maximally
5:24
recruited regardless also strap in again
5:26
here so I can use only my side delts to
5:28
sweep the weight out as opposed to
5:29
relying on my grip and more specifically
5:31
my thumb to support the weight again I
5:34
use a larger than usual ROM on these but
5:36
if that ROM isn't comfortable for you
5:37
you can just stop at 90 degrees so
5:39
parallel to the floor and again as long
5:41
as you're taking the set to failure the
5:43
total activation level will be very
5:45
similar and again after reaching failure
5:46
I'll drop the weight by 30 to 40 percent
5:48
and go to failure again to really finish
5:50
the fibers off I'm getting a little
5:52
extra volume without killing too much
5:54
time by doing a whole other set okay and
5:56
to finish off the First full body day of
5:58
the week we're doing one set of 12 to 50
6:00
reps on the horizontal tow press for the
6:03
calves now doing calf raises on a leg
6:05
press machine is the exact same basic
6:07
movement pattern as doing them on a
6:09
standing calf raise machine because on
6:11
both exercises your leg is straight Not
6:13
Bent however when you're seated your
6:15
upper body doesn't have to bear any of
6:17
the load so I find that I'm able to get
6:18
a better mind muscle connection with my
6:20
calves when I do calf raises on a seated
6:22
leg press machine and once again after
6:24
reaching failure I'll drop the weight
6:26
back by 30 to 40 percent and go to
6:28
failure again one thing to keep in mind
6:29
with the calves is to make sure you
6:31
don't start bouncing on the drop set
6:32
reps a lot of people have a tendency to
6:34
let loose once fatigue starts setting in
6:36
but you'll get the most out of the set
6:37
if you keep your form locked in and
6:39
remember each and every rep should have
6:41
a nice one second or so pause at the
6:43
bottom and a full squeeze at the top
6:44
okay let's jump into full body day two
Full Body Day 2
6:47
on the second day we're kicking things
6:49
off with the hack squat doing one heavy
6:51
top set for four to six reps and then
6:53
one lighter back offset for eight to ten
6:55
reps now the reason I'm going for the
6:57
hack squat is because on a minimalist
6:59
routine you can often get a way with
7:01
less warm-up sets on machines than on
7:03
free weight compound exercises for
7:05
example with barbell back squats it'll
7:07
sometimes take me a half an hour just to
7:09
get all my warm-up sets done whereas
7:10
with the hack squat I'll just hit two
7:12
maybe three quick warm-up sets and then
7:14
I'm doing my working sets within five or
7:16
ten minutes tops so for the first heavy
7:18
top set I'm choosing a weight that'll
7:19
have me about one rep shy of failure so
7:21
an RP of nine for four to six reps and
7:24
here I'm just focusing on moving the
7:26
weight I'm thinking about driving
7:27
through my heels while maintaining
7:29
consistent pressure against the shoulder
7:31
pads and after the first heavy set I'll
7:32
rest for about three minutes and then
7:34
for the back offset I'll drop the weight
7:36
back and this time focus a little more
7:37
on controlling the negative and feeling
7:39
my quads working this is more of the
7:41
hypertrophy set so I'm focusing more on
7:43
the Mind muscle connection rather than
7:45
just moving the weight and on both sets
7:46
I'm getting to full depth and
7:48
purposefully allowing my knees to come
7:49
forward past my toes which is perfectly
7:52
safe and I can link another video on
7:53
that down below okay after that we're
7:55
doing an antagonistic superset for the
7:57
chest and back now an antagonistic
7:59
superset is when you train two opposing
8:01
muscle groups back to back without rest
8:03
I'm a big fan of these because one
8:06
muscle will be working while the other
8:07
is resting so in this case we're doing
8:09
two sets of a high incline Smith machine
8:11
press to Target the pecs shoulders and
8:14
triceps and then we're supersetting that
8:15
with a t-bar row to hit the mid traps
8:17
lats rear delts and to some extent the
8:20
biceps with the incline press I'm
8:22
setting the bench angle a bit higher
8:23
than usual so around 45 to 60 degrees
8:26
and I'm doing that so the delts get more
8:28
involved rather than doing both a
8:29
vertical press and a horizontal press
8:31
we're just meeting in the Middle with a
8:33
high incline press to save on time and
8:35
this will do a good job of hitting the
8:36
pecs and the shoulders with a single
8:38
movement we're also taking a slightly
8:40
closer grip so we can take the triceps
8:42
through a greater range of motion and
8:44
this will shift some of the emphasis to
8:45
the upper pecs as well which is a weak
8:47
point for most people then we're
8:49
supersetting this with 10 to 12 reps on
8:51
the t-bar row now my gems t-bar row
8:53
machine is right next to the Smith
8:54
machine so I can superset these two
8:56
easily but if your gym has these two
8:58
machines further apart instead you can
9:00
just flip around on the bench grab some
9:02
dumbbells and do some chest supported
9:03
incline dumbbell rows instead of t-bar
9:05
rows for the same sets and Reps now I'm
9:07
doing t-bar rows I'll usually do one set
9:09
with a wider grip and one set with a
9:11
closer grip just to Target the back from
9:13
slightly different angles and I should
9:15
also point out that even though we are
9:16
super setting I'll still rest for about
9:18
30 seconds to a minute in between the
9:20
two exercises so just because you're
9:22
super setting and you're going back and
9:23
forth doesn't mean you need to go
9:25
straight to the other exercise getting a
9:27
little rest in between to catch your
9:29
breath is a good idea so in practice the
9:31
Super Saddle looks something more like
9:32
this which still saves on time but
9:34
allows me to recuperate more in between
9:36
supersets alright after that we're
9:38
moving on to one set of 10 to 12 reps on
9:40
the seated hamstring curl plus a drop
9:42
set a recent 2020 study showed greater
9:45
hamstrings growth with seated leg curls
9:47
over lying leg curls across a 12-week
9:49
training study so if we're given the
9:51
option to do only one I pretty much
9:53
always favor seated leg curls these days
9:55
and because this difference seems to be
9:57
related to the higher degree of stretch
9:58
you get on the hamstrings with the
10:00
seated variation I'll accentuate this
10:02
effect by leaning forward over the
10:04
machine throughout the set and then
10:05
since we're only doing one set here
10:07
we're taking it all the way to failure
10:08
and then dropping the weight back by 30
10:10
to 40 percent and going to failure again
10:12
then we're doing one set of 12 to 15
10:14
reps on the Easy Bar bicep curl plus
10:16
some Maya reps again just one all-out
10:19
set to failure here so we want to make
10:21
sure we execute that set as perfectly as
10:23
possible so I'm focusing on curling the
10:25
weight out and up not just up and
10:27
thinking about driving through my pinky
10:29
to cue for supination as I curl I'm also
10:32
thinking about squeezing my biceps to
10:33
move the weight and keeping a looser
10:35
grip on the bar so that my forearms
10:37
don't take over after hitting failure
10:39
with good technique we're doing some
10:40
mile reps to enhance the set further
10:42
rather than a drop set this time so this
10:44
time we're going to keep the weight the
10:46
same and instead of dropping the weight
10:47
back we'll simply rest for three to four
10:49
seconds and then do another four reps
10:51
then we'll rest for another three to
10:53
four seconds and do another four reps
10:55
and we'll just keep doing that until we
10:57
can no longer get four reps at that
10:59
point the set is done now the good thing
11:00
about Maya reps is that they allow you
11:02
to get in a lot more high tension reps
11:04
in a short period of time remember that
11:06
it isn't until near the very end of a
11:08
set the Reps become maximally
11:09
hypertrophic so by doing these myorep
11:11
mini sets where the muscle is already
11:13
very close to failure you're essentially
11:15
cutting out any of those early low
11:17
tension reps and jumping straight to the
11:19
more effective stuff all right and to
11:20
finish off the workout we're doing one
11:22
set of cable crunches for 12 to 15 reps
11:24
plus a double drop set so I like to do
11:27
these kneeling with the Rope locked in
11:28
over my head and then I'll crunch down
11:30
hard on my abs and allow my entire back
11:32
to round including my lower back after
11:34
reaching failure once I'll drop the
11:36
weight back by about 30 percent and then
11:38
go to failure again and then to really
11:40
finish things off we'll do one more drop
11:41
set this time so I'll strip it back
11:43
another 20 to 30 percent and then go to
11:45
failure one last time now if you guys
More Minimalistic Splits
11:47
were wondering how you could adapt this
11:48
to a three four or five day per week
11:50
program this is how I would do it you
11:52
keep most of the exercises sets and Reps
11:55
the same but simply modify how you'd
11:57
split up your volume throughout the week
11:59
if you want to train three days a week I
12:01
do the same full body workout number one
12:03
and then split the second full body day
12:05
up into an upper body day and a lower
12:07
body day you could also add a little
12:08
more volume to the upper lower Days by
12:10
either adding an extra set for some of
12:11
these exercises or you could add a few
12:13
extra exercises for your individual weak
12:16
points on those days if you want to
12:18
train four days a week you just split up
12:19
both full body workouts into two
12:21
separate upper lower days so you go
12:23
upper lower rest upper lower rest rest
12:26
and again you can add some volume to
12:28
these workouts if you find them to be a
12:29
bit too short and if you want to train
12:31
five days a week you could do the same
12:32
basic thing but this time with an upper
12:34
lower Push Pull leg split done five days
12:36
per week or if you want to have all this
12:38
work done for you you can check out my
12:40
new 12-week Essentials program which
12:42
just launched this week over on
12:43
jeffnipper.com it's made up of workouts
12:45
very similar to the ones in this video
12:47
that are designed to get you in and out
12:48
of the gym in under 45 minutes it comes
12:50
in a two day per week three day per week
12:52
four day per week and five day per week
12:54
version and I'm gonna leave it at 20 off
12:56
for another week if you guys want to
12:58
pick it up so that's it for this one
12:59
